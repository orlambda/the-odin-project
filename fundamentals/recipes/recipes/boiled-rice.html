    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I love rice. My rice cooker was damaged when my kitchen flooded because it was on the floor for some reason, so I have been cooking rice in a pan. I use a small pan that fits this rice perfectly.
        The rice may need a quick shake or stir in the middle of cooking but otherwise try not to disturb it.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice, 1 cup</li>
        <li>Water, 1.1 cups</li>
        <li>Salt, just a tiny bit</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rinse and drain the rice a few times until the water runs clear.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the rice in a saucepan, along with the water and salt.
        </li>
        <li>Cook on a medium/high heat until the water gets close to boiling.</li>
        <li>Reduce to a low heat and cook for approx 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, leaving the pan with the lid on for a few minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
